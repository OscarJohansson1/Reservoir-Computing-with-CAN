## Introduction
Reservoir Computing is a technique where we use a dynamical system to process input data and then classify it using a simple readout layer. This repository contains the code for my Master's thesis project. The focus of the project is on simulating cellular automata networks with different update rules and topologies to see which setup works best for recognizing patterns in text. We test various configurations of cellular automata to find the most effective way to classify text patterns.

## Usage
